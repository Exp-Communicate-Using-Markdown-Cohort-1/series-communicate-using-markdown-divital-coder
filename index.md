# there is something to learn about markdownn by using this file as as proof of concept `<h1> HOW ABOUT NOW LADS!??</h1>`
## this is another piece of thing u can add . markdown seems to have no relation with html, we could use the number of octothorpe for assigning the relevant font-size of your text within your markdown file..... 
### and for the sake of adding and displaying a sample blob of text within a highlighted area or a code-block like u send one when hitting the back-ticks on a discord server, its a similar thing here as well. Simple add back-ticks and voila , you can now insert anything within those back-ticks to be displayed as as block of code/text.
#### `this is some code in javascript : function displaysomething(){ connsole.log("my name is cherie deville!")}`
