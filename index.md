# there is something to learn about markdownn by using this file as as proof of concept `<h1> HOW ABOUT NOW LADS!??</h1>`
## this is another piece of thing u can add . markdown seems to have no relation with html, we could use the number of octothorpe for assigning the relevant font-size of your text within your markdown file..... 
### and for the sake of adding and displaying a sample blob of text within a highlighted area or a code-block like u send one when hitting the back-ticks on a discord server, its a similar thing here as well. Simple add back-ticks and voila , you can now insert anything within those back-ticks to be displayed as as block of code/text.
#### `this is some code in javascript : function displaysomething(){ connsole.log("my name is cherie deville!")}`





#### so for the sake of adding images simply use an exclamation mark followed by square brackets, and then round bracktes. The square brackets will hold the relevant alt-text for your image whereas your round-brackets will hold the img-src.

![this is some supporting alt text for an image](https://images.pexels.com/photos/844297/pexels-photo-844297.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=2)


# now its time for adding a code block to your file :
```
let numsArray:numner[] = [];
for(let loopnnum:number = 0; loopnum < 20; loopnum++){
numsArray.push(loopnum+1);
}


for(let num of numsArray){

if((num % 5 === 0) && (num % 3 === 0)){
console.log("FOOBAR");
}
else if(num % 5 ===0){
console.log("Bar");
}
else if(num % 3 === 0){
console.log("Foo");
}

}
```


## its time for task-lists:
- [ ] `make something for your upcoming permahacks blockchain hackathon using arweave`
- [ ] `complete your microsoft learn cloud skills challenge for your microsoft learn student ambassadors program`
- [x] `register and attain github student developer pack for added student benefits`
- [x] `finish building a proof of concpet project within the svelte framework using typescript, so that u understand the gist of the framework and can getstarted usinng the framework for building production level applications fast. Current project in making "sticks-descend"`
